So today, we will be discussing github and its commands.

Github is a VCS i.e. it is a version control system.
The main purpose of a version control system is to enable proper file management and have the history of all the 
versions of our project without having to manually store each version.

Let's talk some common terms:

1. Repo - Repository or Repo is a where one can store their code in github
2. Add - command used to add files in the queue for commiting and pushing onto the Repository from local machine to the remote repo.
3. Pull - copies all changes from the remote repo to the local machine
4. Clone - clones the given repo onto the local machine 
5. Stage - use to put files onto the queue for pushing onto the remote repo
6. Commit - used to confirm changes in the files before pushing onto the remote repo
7. Push - used to reflect changes from the local machine to the remote repo
8. Fork - used to copy a repo by some other author onto the user's github account
9. Branch - different places to organize code in a repo
10. Merge - used to merge 2 branches
11. README - an introductory file provided in the repo to give an insight into the code that is stored
12. Status - gives the details of the differences between the local machine and the remote repo
13. Restore - opposite of stage, that is, it is used to uncommit changes
14. Fetch - used to fetch the changes from the remote repo but does not alter the local repo
15. Init - used to initialize the given directory to a repository
16. Checkout - used to switch branches

Now, I would like all of you to clone this repo, update this file by filling in details of the commands, and pushing this file to your new repo.

For reference, I would encourage all of you to go through official git documentation.

pull and fetch - the difference is that pull reflects the changes in the remote repo into the local workspace whereas the fetch command just fetches the changes and does not alter the local workspace
