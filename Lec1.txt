So today, we will be discussing github and its commands.

Github is a VCS i.e. it is a version control system.
The main purpose of a version control system is to enable proper file management and have the history of all the 
versions of our project without having to manually store each version.

Let's talk some common terms:

1. Repo - stores all files and data associated with a project
2. Add - it adds the changes done in the working directory to the staging area to be committed
3. Pull - brings changes from remote repository to integrate with local repository
4. Clone - copies repository from remote to local device
5. Stage - it readies changes in the working directory to be committed later
6. Commit - saves changes in working directory to local repository
7. Push - sends the changes from local repository to remote
8. Fork - creates a copy of another repository on the users github account
9. Branch - creates a new branch in the repository
10. Merge - combines changes from one branch to another branch
11. README - a file in a repo that usually informs about the repository to a viewer
12. Status - shows status for files which are/aren't staged or committed
13. Restore - reverts changes to a previous state
14. Fetch - retrieves changes from remote but does not merge them into local repository
15. Init - initializes a new git repository
16. Checkout - switches between different branches of a repo

Now, I would like all of you to clone this repo, update this file by filling in details of the commands, and pushing this file to your new repo.

For reference, I would encourage all of you to go through official git documentation.
